# SQL Practice: Electronics Store

This project contains SQL scripts for managing a simple electronics store database (`shopdb`).

## Features
- Create and use `shopdb` database
- Tables: Products, Employees, Sales with foreign keys
- Insert sample data
- Queries: SELECT with filters, JOINs, aggregates (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Data updates and deletions
- Pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET
- Cleanup: drop tables and database

## How to run
Execute the `shopdb.sql` file in any MySQL client (Workbench, CLI, DBeaver).

**Note:** The script drops the database at the end, so use carefully.

# QA-portfolio
This is a QA portfolio project containing manual test cases, checklists, and automated tests written in Python using Pytest and Postman collections for API testing.

## About me 👋
Hi, my name is Volodymyr. I began my journey into QA independently in early 2025 after a career in psychology. The transition came naturally as I realized my passion for solving problems and improving processes could be perfectly applied in software testing.

My background in psychology gave me a strong foundation in analytical thinking, attention to detail, and understanding human behavior — skills that I find very valuable in quality assurance.

I am especially interested in manual testing, where a careful and methodical approach helps catch subtle issues that affect user experience. At the same time, I am actively developing skills in automated testing with Python.

My goal is to build a solid QA foundation that balances thorough manual testing expertise with modern test automation techniques. I am eager to contribute to projects where I can apply my unique background and continuously grow as a QA professional.

## My experience 🏢
Though I have not attended formal QA courses, I am a dedicated self-learner and have gained hands-on experience through personal projects and practice. I have built and executed detailed manual test cases, reported bugs effectively, and automated tests using Python and Pytest.

Working on API testing with Postman further expanded my understanding of backend processes and integration points. My psychological training enhances my ability to anticipate user behavior and edge cases, which helps in creating meaningful test scenarios.

## About Me 👋

Hi, I’m Volodymyr. I transitioned from a career in psychology to self-study quality assurance in early 2025. My background helped me develop strong analytical thinking, attention to detail, and an understanding of user behavior — all essential for quality assurance.

I’m passionate about thorough manual testing and eager to grow my automation skills using Python.

### 🔁 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project also includes continuous integration using **GitHub Actions**:

- You can **run UI tests directly** from the GitHub repository using workflows.
- Supports both automatic runs on `push` and **manual selection** of specific tests (`workflow_dispatch`).
- Tests are executed in a headless Chrome browser on Ubuntu runners.
- Example tests:
  - `test_add_to_cart.py::test_add_cart`
  - `test_search.py::test_search`
  - `test_training_page.py::test_training`

> Test results appear in the **Actions** tab. You can optionally integrate **Allure reports** for detailed test history and trends.
